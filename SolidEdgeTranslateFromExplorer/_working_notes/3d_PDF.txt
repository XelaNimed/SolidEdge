SolidEdgeTranslationServices allows of output of pdf-3D since ST6 MP1
Symptom
---------------
SolidEdgeTranslationServices.exe allows export in batch mode of Solid Edge
files to different formats (pdf-2D, tif, dwg, jt, bmp, igs, etc.). Since ST6
MP1 it is now also possible to convert to pdf-3D.
Hardware/Software Configuration
Solid Edge
Solution
Run 'SolidEdgeTranslationServices.exe' once.  The utility will create a new
entry in the 'Define_SolidEdge_Properties_ForWorkflow_ToSync.ini' file found in
the Solid Edge Program folder and by default is set to 0:

Export 3D PDF from part or Assembly=0

Edit the value to 1 to turn ON this functionality, this should cause the
utility to output 3D pdf files of everything but SE draft files, when selecting
the -t=pdf switch in the command line. e.g:

SolidEdgeTranslationServices -i=C:\Siemens\part.par -o=C:\Siemens\part.pdf   
-t=pdf
