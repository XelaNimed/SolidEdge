; Registry script to set STL .stl files to open by default into a single
; instance of Solid Edge.
;
; Without this registry change simply setting the default behaviour on
; .stl files to always open in Solid Edge through the Windows Explorer
; settings will launch multiple instances of Solid Edge.
;
; Note: This registry change will first remove any existing entries for
; the .stl file associations.  It was found that certain existing
; applications that set various associations for these file types
; caused Solid Edge to hang unless they were first removed before
; associating Solid Edge to the .stl file type.
